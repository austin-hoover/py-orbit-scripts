Tracking from RFQ exit to HZ04 using RFQ simulation as input. The RFQ simulation was launched using old measurements of f(x, x') and f(y, y') in the LEBT at 50 mA beam current. The simulation used 10 million macro-particles and predicted 84% transmission (42 mA output current). It is described in detail here: https://journals.aps.org/prab/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevAccelBeams.23.124201. 

The beam current was varied artificially in the PyORBIT simulation by changing the macrosize attribute of each particle â€” the number of physical particles represented by the macro-particle. The beam current was varied from 22 mA to 50 mA. The results of each run are stored in folders '26mA', '42 mA', etc.

The full coordinate array was saved at the lattice entrance, at the entrance of each quadrupole (QV01, QH02, QV03, QH04), and at the measurement location (HZ04).
