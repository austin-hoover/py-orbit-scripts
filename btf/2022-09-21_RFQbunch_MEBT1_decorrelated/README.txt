Tracking from start to HZ04 using RFQ simulation as input. The RFQ simulation was launched using old measurements of f(x, x') and f(y, y') in the LEBT at 50 mA beam current. The simulation used 10 million macro-particles and predicted 84% transmission (42 mA output current). It is described in detail here: https://journals.aps.org/prab/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevAccelBeams.23.124201. 

The full coordinate array was saved at the lattice entrance, at the entrance of each quadrupole (QV01, QH02, QV03, QH04), and at the measurement location (HZ04).

The cross-plane correlations were removed from the initial bunch before tracking by randomly permuting the (x, x'), (y, y'), (z, z') pairs.
