# PyORBIT scripts

This repository stores PyORBIT scripts for various accelerator physics studies, mostly at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS). I may include scripts from other codes if I end up using them (PARMTEQ is one example).
 
The scripts are organized by general topic or machine area (ring injection, linac, instabilities, etc.). For each topic, I plan to store both generic scripts (e.g., injection.py) and scripts specific to certain studies/benchmarks (e.g., injection for 300 turns, with anti-correlated painting, ...). The latter should be stored in dated folders, along with all inputs (lattice files, etc.) and analysis notebooks. Large input bunch files are stored elsewhere.
